# Admin Dashboard App made with React as a Final Project for React Class - DWIT

## The project follows react based development styles with a lot of modularity in mind. It also makes use of TailwindCSS for styling purposes. And is very responsive.

âœ… I wanted to create something substantial for this project so I followed a YouTube tutorial and made some changes of my own. I've also made some substantial use of third party libraries like syncfusion and react-icons.
